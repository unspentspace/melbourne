## Executive Summary

Bitcoin cyberpsace culture in Australia has grown considerably in the last few years. If you look at the capital city cyberspace groups (telegram), there are approximately 1100 members (which probably include crossover). From these groups, there are consistent meetups in at least Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth. Since 2021, there have been a new kind of meatspace attraction, the 'bitcoin bush bash', which happens in country towns in Victoria, NSW and Queensland each year. The private cyberspace group for attendees has grown to 139 members. That is 139 real humans who have gone out of their way to drive or fly multiple hours to be with other bitcoiners. Suffice to say, demand for meatspace is growing.

On a selfish note, the founders of unspent.space all have a shared desire: to be in meatspace with other bitcoiners. Whether it's sitting next to someone while fiat mining, or sharing a coffee break with a friend, we can't get enough of the bitcoin scene, and we love learning from others. Our thesis is that there are at least 30 like-minded people in Melbourne who share this desire.

Based on our research, thinking and debates, we believe the best way to solve this meatspace problem is to secure a property and to operate a space for bitcoiners to co-work, share and learn together.

We are not currently looking for investment as we'd like to start small and maintain control of the Melbourne project in its beginning. The first year will cost us in the range of $80k - $120k depending on participation, and we anticipate a return of -10% to 10%. The first year will be the most difficult and will see the least return. Our aim in the first five years is to maintain a reasonable profit to be able to re-invest and grow the business.

## Rationale

### Background

There is a growing demand around the world for physical spaces for bitcoiners, whether it be co-working, hacker space, event space or just meeting up (case-in-point examples include Bitcoin Commons, Bitcoin Grove, Bitcoin Park, Pleb Lab, h4ckbs). These spaces also exist to be the sanctuary and learning space for like-minded folk wishing to advance bitcoin adoption.

I (@bitcoinCrispy on telegram) and some others, have been thinking about the viability of a space (co-working, workshop, events etc) in Melbourne. The main goal would be to create a physical space for bitcoiners to exchange ideas, build relationships and build products that will help the ecosystem.

While there have been failed attempts in the past (Blockchain Melbourne which was formerly Bitcoin Melbourne), ultimately there hasn't been a sustainable model.

I personally believe that it is inevitable that this will happen, whether it's the right time or not. So I thought it would be good to gauge interest that can shape future actions.

Terms defined:

- **Bitcoiner:** an individual who is passionate about bitcoin and its characteristics.
- **Bitcoin Business:** any business that is built around the bitcoin technology stack.
- **Cypherpunk:** a group of individuals championing the use of cryptography to challenge existing social and political status quo concerning privacy, and contributes to the development of privacy-focused technologies to support the movement.

#### _The problem is that cyberspace is not enough to foster a local culture, a meatspace is necessary. For bitcoin understanding to grow locally, we need a consistent place that people can organise around._

There is currently no place in Melbourne for bitcoiners to work, talk and play together. Why is this a problem? Surely we could just meet at the park, or hire a council meeting room occasionally?

Well, this is not a problem if you are happy with the status quo in our city. If you’re happy that there is high friction for bitcoiners to collide and interact, then there is no problem.

However, if you, like me, are frustrated that you cannot wake up in the morning and spend many waking hours working alongside, talking to, and learning from other bitcoiners and cypherpunks, then there IS A PROBLEM.

It is also a problem because there are many places, for example in the United States, that are advancing their bitcoin culture quite rapidly, and I think Melbourne (not to mention Australia) is at risk of being left behind.

Many bitcoiners are private people and so it is difficult to measure the passion that exists in our community. But if I base it on the meetups that I’ve organised or attended in the last 18 months, there are at least 100 passionate bitcoiners that live and breathe the technology.


# Scope


## In Scope

- This outcome for this proposal is to establish a business which operates a physical space in Melbourne. It may or may not include space for:

  - Working desks and power facilities
  - Private meeting rooms
  - Recording studio
  - Kitchenette
  - Reading space/ library
  - Hardware workshop


- The business must be financially sustainable, not permanently relying on funding/grants.
- The business will operate on a premises owned or leased by the business. It will not exist as part of a wider co-working space (while this could be worthwhile, it is not part of this particular proposal).
- Based on local knowledge and surveying, we have narrowed the geographic search to the hoddle st/ punt road corridor focussed on Richmond.

## Out of Scope

- Given the current local environment, this business case will not aim to build an incubator/venture studio. While we hope that businesses can be spawned from people meeting and working together in a shared space, we don't believe that Melbourne is quite ready for that kind of business model.

# Business Options


## Option 1: Start a for profit company

Description: This option involves creating a standard business model with 2-3 owners/partners. It may involve employing one to two people to manage and grow the community, or it could be run mostly as self-service. It would focus on servicing a small number of people for daytime use and events and workshops on evenings and weekends.


## Option 2: Start a not-for-profit association

Description: This option involves creating a [co-operative](https://business.gov.au/planning/business-structures-and-types/business-structures/co-operative) (pardon the communist reference) or association of at least 5 members. Dissimilar to option 1, the space would operate on a relatively smaller budget and initially with little to no employees. This option might rely on some level of volunteering by its members to maintain the premises. It will give greater control and privacy for members, as compared to option 1.

For a list of Victorian cooperatives as examples, visit this [website](https://www.coopdevelopment.org.au/viclinks.html#finance).

## Option 3: Do Nothing

This option involves not doing anything. Likely another business or set of individuals will eventually try this, with some degree of success. But in the meantime, for the Melbourne bitcoin community, options to meet will be limited to parks, pubs, renting council facilities and the Blockchain Centre at RMIT (Melbourne Bitcoin Developers meetup). We think this option will not contribute to bitcoin cultural and code contribution development in Melbourne.


## Comparison of Options

| **Option** | **Option 1**                                                                      | **Option 2**                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Pros**   | - Incentive for outside investment - Flexibility in adapting to changing conditions - Little to no risk to customers | - Non-profit, no investors - Difficult to co-opt mission - Can operate with little capital - Owned and controlled by members                                                  |
| **Cons**   | - Capital startup risk for founders  - Operations responsibility all on owners                                           | - Too many members coordination/agreements issues? - Less likely to attract capital |


# Benefits

The benefits are based on Option 1, the standard for-profit company business model.

## Expected Benefits

- Provides a consistent place for bitcoin friendly events and educational activities to be hosted.
- Provides opportunities for like-minded individuals to meet and create relationships.
- Provides an opportunity for a modest revenue and profit to be able to reinvest and support the development of the space.
- Provides incentive for international bitcoiners to spend time in Melbourne.


## Expected Dis-benefits

No significant disbenefits have been identified, yet. Undoubtedly there will be some.


# Timescale

Aim for launch in Q4 2023 or Q1 2024.

# Costs

Initial 1 year cost target is in the range of $72,000 - $92,000

# Investment Appraisal

Investment appraisal is located in the private folder.

## Return on investment

The first year return is anticipated range from -10% to 10%. Full financial model on investment is located in the private repository.

## Funding requested

No funding sought at this stage. Funding for first year is to be provided by founders.

# Major Risks

- Shitcoins: there is a low risk, albeit it is a risk. The risk is mitigated by making the vision very public from the start and having founders who understand this risk and are passionate about bitcoin. This risk is best abated by fostering a strong community, which is already growing in the Melbourne Bitcoin Only telegram group.
- Dominated by one or a couple of companies: by starting this business with founder's capital and no other company interest, this puts us at an advantage with regards to this risk. The risk can also be mitigated by not relying on businesses alone for the business model to work.
- Financial risk: given that this will be a small membership base with a relatively low capital cost for starting, the risk is medium and the impact is relatively low to all founders.
- Targeting by regulators: this is a low risk, as the business will not operate as an exchange or investing firm. The business is a co-working space primarily, with very few members relatively.
