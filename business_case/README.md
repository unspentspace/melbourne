# Business Case - A Melbourne Bitcoin Space

## Executive Summary


## Rationale


### Background

There is a growing demand for co-working and private spaces around the world for bitcoiners, bitcoin businesses and Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) development (case-in-point examples include Bitcoin Commons, Bitcoin Grove, Bitcoin Park, Pleb Lab, h4ckbs). These spaces also exist to be the sanctuary and learning space for like-minded folk wishing to advance bitcoin adoption.

I (@bitcoinCrispy on telegram) and some others, have been thinking about the viability of a space (co-working, workshop, events etc) in Melbourne. The main goal would be to create a physical space for bitcoiners to exchange ideas, build relationships and build products that will help the ecosystem.

While there have been failed attempts in the past (Blockchain Melbourne which was formerly Bitcoin Melbourne), ultimately there hasn't been a sustainable model.

I personally believe that it is inevitable that this will happen, whether it's the right time or not. So I thought it would be good to gauge interest that can shape future actions.

Terms defined:

- **Bitcoiner:** an individual who is passionate about bitcoin and its characteristics.
- **Bitcoin Business:** any business that is built around the bitcoin technology stack.
- **Cypherpunk:** a group of individuals championing the use of cryptography to challenge existing social and political status quo concerning privacy, and contributes to the development of privacy-focused technologies to support the movement.


### Problem

> “The question is not whether your part of the world is going to change. The question is how.”
_Edward T. McMahon_

> "Be the change you wish to see in the world."
_Ghandi_

There is currently no place in Melbourne for bitcoiners to work, talk and play together. Why is this a problem? Surely we could just meet at the park, or hire a council meeting room occasionally?

Well, this is not a problem if you are happy with the status quo in our city. If you’re happy that there is high friction for bitcoiners to collide and interact, then there is no problem.

However, if you, like me, are frustrated that you cannot wake up in the morning and spend many waking hours working alongside, talking to, and learning from other bitcoiners and cypherpunks, then there IS A PROBLEM.

It is also a problem because there are many places, for example in the United States, that are advancing their bitcoin culture quite rapidly, and I think Melbourne (not to mention Australia) is at risk of being left behind.

Many bitcoiners are private people and so it is difficult to measure the passion that exists in our community. But if I base it on the meetups that I’ve organised or attended in the last 18 months, there are at least 100 passionate bitcoiners that live and breathe the technology.


# Scope


## In Scope

- This outcome for this proposal is to establish a business which operates a physical space in Melbourne. It may or may not include space for:

  - Working desks and power facilities
  - Private meeting rooms
  - Recording studio
  - Kitchenette
  - Reading space/ library
  - Hardware workshop


- The business must be financially sustainable, not permanently relying on funding/grants.
- The business will operate on a premises owned or leased by the business. It will not exist as part of a wider co-working space (while this could be worthwhile, it is not part of this particular proposal).


## Out of Scope

- Given the current local environment, this business case will not aim to build an incubator/venture studio. While we hope that businesses can be spawned from people meeting and working together in a shared space, we don't believe that Melbourne is quite ready for that kind of business model.

# Business Options


## Option 1: Start a for profit company

Description: This option involves creating a standard business model with 2-3 owners/partners. It initially involves employing one to two people to manage and grow the community.


## Option 2: Start a not-for-profit association

Description: This option involves creating a[co-operative](https://business.gov.au/planning/business-structures-and-types/business-structures/co-operative) (pardon the communist reference) of at least 5 members. Dissimilar to option 1, the space would operate on a relatively smaller budget and initially with little to no employees. This option might rely on some level of volunteering by its members to maintain the premises. It will give greater control and privacy for members, as compared to option 1.

For a list of Victorian cooperatives as examples, visit this[website](https://www.coopdevelopment.org.au/viclinks.html#finance).


## Option 3: Do Nothing

This option involves not doing anything. Likely another business or set of individuals will eventually try this, with some degree of success. But in the meantime, for the Melbourne bitcoin community, options to meet will be limited to parks, pubs, renting council facilities and the Blockchain Centre at RMIT (Melbourne Bitcoin Developers meetup). We think this option will not contribute to bitcoin cultural and code contribution development in Melbourne.


## Comparison of Options

| **Option** | **Option 1**                                                                      | **Option 2**                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Pros**   | - Visible to public, foot traffic - More likely to attract investment/sponsorship | - A private, controlled space - Difficult to co-opt mission - Can operate with little capital                                                    |
| **Cons**   | - More expensive capital startup cost                                             | - Too many members coordination/agreements issues? - Less likely to inject capital - Difficulty attracting members, usually little to no profit. |
